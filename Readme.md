# Random Dog Image API Project

This is a straightforward web application that allows users to fetch and view a random dog image by clicking a button. 

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Dog API, which provides access to a vast database of dog images. Each time the "Get Random Dog Image" button is clicked, the application fetches a new random image and displays it on the page. 

It's a fun and interactive way to explore various adorable dog pictures! ðŸ˜„
